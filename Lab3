# Netflix Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset.  
The goal is to understand the structure of the dataset, clean missing values, explore patterns, and visualize insights using Python.

This assignment demonstrates data cleaning, visualization, and basic analysis techniques using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
